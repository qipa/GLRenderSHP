# GLRenderSHP
Basic OpenGL ShapeFile viewer. The shapefile format is a popular geospatial vector data format for geographic information system (GIS) software. It is developed and regulated by Esri as a (mostly) open specification for data interoperability among Esri and other GIS software products. The shapefile format can spatially describe vector features: points, lines, and polygons, representing, for example, water wells, rivers, and lakes. Each item usually has attributes that describe it, such as name or temperature.

This is a simple viewer for ShapeFiles. We use shapelib to load the .shp and .dbf and render the data.
